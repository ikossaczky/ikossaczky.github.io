This page collects usefull VS code extensions and configurations to get productive quickly after installing VS code on another machine.


## Extensions
- [WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl): Work in VS code under WSL. Use native linux terminal, git, python/conda installed under WSL etc.

- [Markdown+Math](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath): the only extension I found which renders nicely Markdown+Katex into HTML. Unfortunatelly not into PDF, the best way to convert to PDF is to open the reulting PDF in browser and print to PDF (as stated [here](https://github.com/yzane/vscode-markdown-pdf/issues/259))
