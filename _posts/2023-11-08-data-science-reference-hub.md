## Websites
List of websites having lot of different interesting content.

[**distill.pub**](https://distill.pub/): Machine learning research journal, focused on very clear explanations using visualisations and interactive examples. Unfortunately, currently discontinued.

[**ekamperi.github.io**](https://ekamperi.github.io/): Good data science blog of Stathis Kamperis on various topics: Bayesian optimizations, trees, autoencoders.

[**Interpretable Machine Learning book**](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/) by Christoph Molnar, online version. To be read.

[**jalammar.github.io**](https://jalammar.github.io/): Website of Jay Alammar. Very good visual explanations of neural network structures and concepts behind LLMs and vision models.

[**krasserm.github.io**](https://krasserm.github.io/): Great blogs on various ML topics by Martin Krasser, especially good explanations about Bayesian
approaches.

[**statproofbook.github.io**](https://statproofbook.github.io/). The Book of Statistical Proofs. Great collection of statistical definitions and proofs.

## Posts
List of interesting posts, blogs, videos, tutorials or papers on a single topic.

[**Conditional normal distribution derivation**](https://statproofbook.github.io/P/mvn-cond.html). Multidimensional case.

[**Generalized Linear Models, lecture notes**](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/advmethods/notes/glm.pdf) by Ryan Tibshirani, very understandable explanation

[**github.com/karpathy/micrograd**](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd): Great minimalistic neural network framework by Andrej Karpathy. Perfect for understanding how the neural network training exactly works.

[**Illustrated transformer**](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) by Jay Allamar, for me the best intro into some concepts behind the current LLMs. See also later posts on the changes done in GPT architectures.

[**Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbWVVCc8x3A), derivation of iteratively reweighted least squares which is basically newton method for finding solution to GLM. Very hard to find this derivation on internet.

[**State of GPT**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZQun8Y4L2A&t=1510s) video by Andrej Karpathy. Great introduction into components of ChatGPT related  architectures, with high level explanation of transformer, supervised finetuning, reward modeling, RLHF, chains and agents

[**Wikipedia: Matrix Calculus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_calculus): Good reference point for nontrivial multidimensional calculus rules.

## Books
List of books I have read, which I would also recommend to others. I include link to the edition I have read (in chronological order), but often newer and hence better edition already exists.

[**Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781491962282/) (Aur√©lien Geron): Very good starter book on machine learning both "classical" and deep learning. Great balance between theory, intuition and code.

[**The Linux Command Line**](https://www.linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) (William Shotts): Great book for finally understanding bash, resp. learning it from scratch. Also freely available in [electronic from](https://www.linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php).

[**Fluent Python**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python/9781491946237/) (Luciano Ramalho): Advanced python concepts, well explained. Quite long book.

[**SQL Pocket Guide**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-pocket-guide/9781492090397/) (Alice Zhao): Short and concise guide to SQL. Great to learn SQL fast.

[**Spark: The Definitive Guide**](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/spark-the-definitive/9781491912201/) (Bill Chambers, Matei Zaharia): All about Spark including advanced topics like Spark machine learning, structured streaming, RDDs and mechanisms behind the spark engine. Code examples in both Python and Scala.
