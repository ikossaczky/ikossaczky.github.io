This blog is focused on technology, mainly machine learning, applied maths and coding, all of it explained in hopefully precise, but definitely boring way.

Although my primary goal is to keep these notes for myself, I hope they can be also helpful for random readers coming along. 

It's also important to keep the things boring, so that the random readers don't get distracted from more important tasks for too long.

Wishing all visitors a moderate reading experience,
