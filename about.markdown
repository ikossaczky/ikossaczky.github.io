This website serves as a space for posts and notes on tech-related topics I find interesting or worth to be remebered.

Although my primary goal is to keep the notes for myself, I hope they can be helpfull also for readers who come along. 

The posts here are mainly about one of the following topics:

- Machine learning / deep learning
- Applied mathematics / statistics
- Notes on programming / scripting
